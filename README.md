# DigitalClock
Dynamic digital clock 3D animated and it moved with movement of cursor.

This project is a modern, animated 3D digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock not only shows the current time, but also has visual effects such as glowing animations, a 3D transformation, and particles for an "out of the world" appearance. Additionally, the clock rotates dynamically to face the user's mouse cursor, creating an interactive experience.

# Features

Real-time Digital Clock: Displays the current time, including hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

3D Effect: The clock is wrapped in a 3D frame that dynamically adjusts its orientation based on mouse movement.

Glowing Animation: The clock has glowing effects to give it a futuristic, high-tech feel.

Floating Particles: Animated particles surround the clock, adding a visually immersive experience.

Responsive Design: The clock maintains its functionality and visual appeal across different screen sizes.

# How It Works

The clock uses JavaScript to continually update the displayed time every millisecond.

Mouse movement is tracked using JavaScript, and the clock rotates in response, giving it a 3D-following effect.

CSS animations are used to create glowing text, float effects, and particles.

# Getting Started

To run the digital clock, simply open the index.html file in your favorite web browser. The JavaScript and CSS are embedded directly in the HTML, so no additional setup is required.

Prerequisites

A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)

# Installation

Clone or download this repository.

Open the index.html file in your browser.

# Customization

Feel free to customize the following aspects:

Colors and Animations: You can modify the CSS to change the color scheme, animations, and effects.

Number of Particles: Change the number of particles or adjust their properties in the createParticles() function to achieve different visual effects.

# Technologies Used

HTML5: To structure the web page.

CSS3: For 3D transformations, animations, and visual styling.

JavaScript: To handle real-time clock updates, mouse movement tracking, and particle animations.

# Demo

To see the 3D clock in action, simply open the HTML file in your browser, move your mouse around, and watch as the clock follows your cursor while showing a glowing 3D effect.
